- Playing with animals makes them happy
- Feeding animals makes them less hungry
- Resting animals makes them less sleepy
- Animals start "neutral" on all metrics
- Happiness should decrease over time
- Hunger should increase over time
- Sleepiness should increase over time
- Happiness should decrease faster when sleep or hunger is full
- Each animal type should have metrics which increase/decrease at different rates
